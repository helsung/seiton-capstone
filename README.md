# Seiton 整頓

> Seiton is part of the **5S**, a Japanese workplace organization method. Seiton means determining where and when items are needed, and placing them in a way that promotes efficient work flow. A worker should not have to hunt for necessary tools, or walk to another area to access often-used items. 

[Seiton](https://seiton-fsa.herokuapp.com/orgs) is a project management tool that allows for seamless, real-time collaboration through customizable kanban boards. Sign up in seconds via Google, invite your co-workers to your boards, and start collaborating in real-time as you wade through the chaotic fast-paced world of modern project cycles!

## Tech Stack

We built our fullstack application with `Next.js`, utilizing `React` and `Redux Tool Kit` to manage client state and UI, and `TailwindCSS` for our custom styles. For our database, we used `Prisma` for our ORM, and [`Pusher API`](https://pusher.com/) to synchronize websockets with `Next.js`'s serverless functions. Both our `PostgresQL` database, as well as our bundled build, is hosted on `Heroku`.
